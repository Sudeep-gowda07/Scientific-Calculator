 Some explanations for each button and the function which represents are the following :

1st Row :

abs : The absolute value of a number (e.g. abs(-5) = 5). 

mod : From modulo. it's the operation to find the remainder of the division of one number by another. In python we use the symbol % (e.g. 5mod2 = 5%2 = 1). 

div : Floor division returns the result of the division rounded down to the nearest integer. In python we use the symbol // (e.g. 8div3 = 8//3 = 2). 

x! : The factorial of the number x (e.g. 4! = 24). 

e : The Euler's number. A mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.


2nd Row :

sin : Sine of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. sin(90)=1). 

cos : Cosine of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. cos(180)=-1). 

tan : Tangent of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. tan(45)=1). 

cot : Cotangent of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. cot(45) = 1/tan(45) = 1). 

π : Archimedes' constant defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is approximately equal to 3.14159.

x2 : x raised to the power of 2 (e.g. 42 = 16). 

x3 : x raised to the power of 3 (e.g. 53 = 125). 

xn : x raised to any power (e.g. 24 = 16 ). 

x-1 : x raised to the power of (-1). The inverse of number x (e.g. 2-1 = 0.5).

10x : Powers of 10 (e.g. 103 = 1000).


4th Row :

2√ : Square root of a number (e.g. 2√144 = 12). 

3√ : Cube root of a number (e.g. 3√8 = 2).

√ : Any root of a number (e.g. 4√16 = 2). 

log10 : The logarithm of a number with base 10 (e.g. log101000 = 3). 

ln : The logarithm of a number with base e (e.g. logee = ln e = 1).


5th Row :

( : Left parenthesis.

) : Right parenthesis. 

± : Change the sign of a number. 

% : Find the percentage of a number (e.g. 5% = 0.05). 

ex : Expotential function (e.g. e2=approx 7.389 ). 6th,7th,8th,9th Row


In these rows are :

-> The basic number buttons (0 to 9).

-> The basic math symbols (operators) (+, -, *, /).

 -> The equal sign (=) and point (.). 
 
-> Button DEL to delete one or more from the end of the entry. 

-> Button AC to delete the whole entry. 

-> EXP : Multiply any number with powers of 10 (e.g. 2 * 10 ** 3 = 2000).
